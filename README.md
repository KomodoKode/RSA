## What is RSA?

RSA is a *public key algorithm* used to secret keys on public channels.

## How Does it Work?
You can read the Wikipedia article for more information,
but the **basic** description is as follows:
>RSA is a algorithm based on the difficulty of prime
>factorizing numbers. 
>**STEPS**
>- Find two large primes.
## IMPORTANT

This is not a fully-secure version of RSA.
